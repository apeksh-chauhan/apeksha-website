In August 2016, I boarded a flight to United States - little did I know at the time that I would still be here eight years later. My journey began on the 5-square-kilometer campus of the University of Maryland, where I pursued my master's degree. Two years later, I landed a full-time role at my dream company - Amazon Web Services. That's when my professional journey truly began. Over nearly seven years at AWS (6 years and 11 months, to be exact), the company became more than just a workplace - it became a space where I grew both professionally and personally. I started as a Cloud Support Engineer, was promoted to Cloud Support Engineer II, transitioned to Technical Account Manager role, and eventually advanced to Senior Technical Account Manager. During this time, I gained a set of skills and tools that have been instrumental to my growth. I believe they're worth reflecting on - and perhaps, they might help others on similar paths. 


**Delivering Impact Consistently**

As a fresh graduate, I often looked up to tenured engineers and wondered: How do they drive such complex, high-impact projects? After walking the path myself, I’ve come to realize that the answer lies in two things:

1. Complete ownership, and

2. Consistently delivering outcomes—regardless of the size or visibility of the task.

To me, ownership means understanding the entire system and operating as if you own every aspect of the project - from ideation and strategy to execution and final outcomes. It’s not just about completing your piece; it’s about thinking end-to-end and taking responsibility for success or failure.

There’s no fixed formula for delivering great results. But one thing that’s worked for me is being able to connect my day-to-day actions to broader objectives—and doing that consistently over time. When you do this, you naturally seek better ways to move the needle. And over time, that habit builds trust with your stakeholders.

**You Don't Always need to be a specialist**

I say this at the risk of alienating my specialist friends, but in tech, change is the only constant. Tools evolve, tech stack changes, new services and features get launched, best practices get re-written, we are in the middle of one such shift right now with AI. 

During my time at AWS, I saw mechanisms and tools deprecated, and priorities being realigned, more times than I can count. This constant flux forces you into a continuous loop of learning and unlearning. And while I never build a personal “system” of learning new skills overnight, one thing that’s kept me afloat is stay aware of what’s changing - and building strong enough foundation to adapt quickly when it does. 

In a world where the tools might change tomorrow, your ability to learn quickly is more important than being an expert in what’s popular today. 

**Your time is Valuable - Use it Intentionally**

Two habits that made me significantly more efficient were:

1. Time boxing, and

2. Individual task tracking.

In my early days in support, I had to balance learning new concepts with assisting customers in a timely manner. Time boxing helped me manage this. I’d allocate a fixed window to investigate deeply, and if I didn’t have a path forward by the end of that time, I’d seek guidance. It kept me moving without spinning my wheels.

For task tracking, I kept things simple — a Quip document where I noted the activity, progress, and a few supporting notes. It helped me stay organized, plan better, and most importantly, reflect on where my time was actually going. Over time, it became a powerful tool during one-on-ones, mid-year reviews, and promotion cycles to articulate the impact I was driving.

Small habits, big outcomes.

**Clarity Is Your Best Tool**

Communication in the workplace shows up in many forms: status updates, knowledge-sharing sessions, strategy documents, 2-pagers, 6-pagers, emails, design docs, feedback, and interviews. Each of these has its own purpose and style—but what ties them all together is a core set of principles: Clarity. Correctness. Conciseness. And when relevant—data.

If I had to name the two biggest enemies of effective communication, I’d say: weasel words and fluff. They dilute trust and confuse intent. It took me conscious effort to remove them from my writing and speaking, but the payoff was worth it.

Here are a few areas where communication made the biggest difference for me:

1. Feedback: Be Clear, Actionable, and Kind
Giving and receiving feedback is table stakes for growth. I use a simple three-part model:

What is the feedback?


Why does it matter?


How can it be acted upon?


This format makes feedback constructive instead of vague—and easier to absorb.

2. Interviews: Say What You Saw

As a bar raiser who conducted 150+ interviews, I made it a point to write feedback using the STAR format - Situation, Task, Action, Result. It ensured I was specific, objective, and useful to decision-makers. Clear documentation leads to better hiring decisions, period.

3. Saying “No” or “I Don’t Know”: Say It Early and Own It

Early in my career, I struggled with saying “No” or admitting “I don’t know.” But both became easier once I realized: we operate in systems with constraints. Not having all the answers is normal. What matters is what you do next.

My rule was simple:

If I know the answer, I share it.


If I don’t, I say so - and take a follow-up action.


Over time, I found this built more trust than pretending to have certainty.

Strong communication isn't about being polished—it's about being honest, clear, and useful. Once I focused on those three, everything else got easier.

As I reflect on nearly seven years at AWS, I’m incredibly grateful for the lessons, challenges, and growth it gave me - both as a professional and as a person. The tools I picked — ownership, adaptability, clarity in communication, and a bias for impact—have shaped how I think, work, and lead. But the journey doesn’t end here. I’m excited to keep learning, building, and contributing in new ways. If any of these reflections resonate with you, I’d love to connect and learn about the principles that shaped your own path.
