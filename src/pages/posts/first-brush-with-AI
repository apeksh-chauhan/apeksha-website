For the past two years, I had been observing the rise of Generative AI from the sidelines. The pace at which the space was evolving felt overwhelming - like jumping into cold rapids. I’ve always been more of a lazy-river person. Though I had some exposure to AI tools at work, I never ventured to use them in a personal context.

So what finally made me take the plunge?

A simple project: building a static website. Nothing too wild.

Let me clarify upfront - this isn’t a tutorial on how to use ChatGPT or GenAI tools. Instead, it’s a narration of my first hands-on experience, complete with reflections and lessons learned.

**Why Build a Static Website?**

For years, owning a personal website was one of those “maybe someday” projects. This year, I decided to make it happen. I also wanted to learn something new - especially since the last time I’d touched HTML was over 15 years ago.

Because I only needed a simple, static site, my husband recommended Astro, a modern framework for building static websites. I visited their site, found their blog tutorial - which I highly recommend - and began working through it step by step.

The tutorial is organized into six digestible modules covering the full spectrum: from setting up your dev environment to creating pages, layouts, and applying styling. It introduces concepts only when necessary, making it friendly for beginners.

After finishing just two modules, I already had a decent structure: three pages - Home, Blog, and About. The blog page listed posts, each linking to its respective content. At this point, I felt confident enough to take it from there. All I needed was a bit of styling, and I could start publishing.

**Enter ChatGPT**

Based on what friends had told me, ChatGPT was great at brainstorming ideas - so I turned to it for help with design. I asked for suggestions on styling: colors, fonts, and overall aesthetic for a semi-professional look. It offered decent guidance.

As I was progressing with styling the website, I wasn't able to figure out how to extend the styling to .md files. For those unfamiliar with Astro (and other static site frameworks), content can be written in Markdown (.md) files, which is then rendered as HTML. The problem I encountered was that my global CSS applied to .astro pages, but not to the .md files. I returned to ChatGPT for help, again.

**The Prompt Spiral**

This was my first time experimenting with prompt engineering - a way to structure instructions to get the best output from an AI model. My initial prompt was straightforward:

“Can you suggest how I extend the CSS layout to the .md file pages?”

ChatGPT responded with:

"Great question! Since you're using .md files as content pages (likely with Astro.glob or dynamic route setup), you'll want consistent styling across them. Here's how to do that:"

And then came a detailed plan:

Create a layout file (e.g., BaseLayout.astro)

Import global CSS in that layout

Reference the layout in each .md file’s frontmatter

Honestly, it was solid advice. In hindsight, it was the right path. But I didn’t know that at the time - because I hadn’t completed the remaining four modules of the tutorial.

Instead of continuing the tutorial, I tried to bypass the layout approach and asked:

“Can I accomplish this without creating a base layout?”

ChatGPT, trying to be helpful, said: “Yes” - and suggested an alternative approach using dynamic routing, a slug.astro file, and moving posts into a content directory. It started giving me code snippets and restructure suggestions.

At that point, I entered what I call "vibe coding mode" - copy-pasting without understanding. Eventually, I lost track of all the changes. I felt frustrated. The project had shifted from building a website to trying to get the right answer from ChatGPT. And worse - it wasn’t fun anymore.

**Re-centering**

That’s when I stopped to ask: What was my goal again?

I had two objectives:

Learn something new - specifically, how Astro works.

Build a functioning static website.

I might have reached the second, but I definitely wasn’t optimizing for the first.

So, I went back to the tutorial and finished all six modules. Slowly. Deliberately. By the end, I had a far deeper understanding of the framework. I could create pages, components, and layouts confidently. Most importantly, I knew what each line of code did and where each style lived.

Then, just to test how much ChatGPT had evolved, I gave it a structured 11-point prompt asking it to build the same site from scratch. It did a decent job. I could have gotten something better with more detailed prompts.

**Reflections: What This Experience Taught Me**

While this was a basic project, it prompted several thoughts on how we interact with GenAI tools - especially when learning something new.

1. Reaching the destination isn’t the only goal.
Somewhere along the way, finishing the website became more important than understanding how to build it. I wasn’t using ChatGPT to support my learning - I was using it to skip steps. That created a disconnect from the very thing I wanted to learn.

In retrospect, I should have first understood the framework fundamentals and then used ChatGPT for syntax checks, code optimization, or deeper explanations. Used that way, it’s an excellent accelerator - not a substitute.

2. The joy of learning lies in the struggle.
ChatGPT didn’t take away the joy - I did, by leaning on it too early. Learning is messy, sometimes slow, and always richer when you earn your breakthroughs.

3. Are we becoming owners of applications we don’t understand?
In my previous role as a support engineer, I often helped customers troubleshoot systems built by someone else. They “owned” the product but didn’t understand its internals. It’s the same risk with AI-generated code: we can end up responsible for systems we didn’t fully create or understand.

Is that necessarily bad? Not always. I own plenty of appliances in my house that I couldn’t fix if they broke (hello, refrigerator). But if something goes wrong, I need a plan to fix it - or know whom to call.

As developers or builders, we’re responsible for the build, deploy, and maintain lifecycle of our products. GenAI tools make those jobs easier, but we still own the outcome.

So… what’s my outlook now?
GenAI tools are here to stay. That was my view before the project, and it still holds.

Did I find value as a user? Absolutely.

Once I had the basics in place, ChatGPT saved me time and offered meaningful guidance - especially for syntax, best practices, and debugging.

But here’s my key takeaway:

GenAI is not a replacement for understanding.
It’s an amplifier - for those who already know what they’re doing. The responsibility for what we build still lies with us.
