- Wanted a learn something new. I turned to Astro to meet 2 goals - 1/ learn something new and 2/ build this website. 
- I started with the blog tutorials. Mid way into the tutorial I thought I had all the info I needed and felt ready start doing nothings on my own. That was mistake number 1. I soon hit a roadblock on how to import styling on the MD file. I thought, hey let me use ChatGPT. That would be quick. Little did I know, that won’t be the case. 
- Question that I asked myself - what am I optimizing for - learning or expedience? The answer was simple, think back to the original goal - learning something new?  I suppose in the act of completing the project was I trying to take a short cut. At least that’s what it felt like. 
- So I went back to the basics. Read through the building blocks of Astro in their documentation. Completed the tutorial end to end. Only to realize, if I had completed the tutorial in the first place, I would have found the answer that I was looking for. 
- Next just to satiate my curiosity, I went back to ChatGPT and told it exactly what I looking in the prompt and generate the code for the website. ……. 
- Learning from the experience is that I had a working website but would have no idea of the building blocks the went into building the website. From my first experience, I knew GpT wasn’t great at troubleshooting. 
- This reminded me of the story - The machine stops. 
- Is communication the one true skill that outlives.
